# Sceletus

Sceletus is an improved version of the Java framework that was developed and
used by myself for a lot of projects. I try to standardise it a bit, so it can
be used as a foundation for other projects as well.

Feel free to use, share, fork or contribute. The framework is licenced under
the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence.

## Components

There are two main components that help you save time while developing a module
based, multi threaded application with Sceletus. Modules and Queues.

## Configuration

The whole framework is configured with a simple JSON file at the moment.
No include or overwriting is supported, but I plan to something with that.
